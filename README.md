## Description

- What was your motivation? The purpose of this project was to create an easy=to-use weather app where our users, whether they are commuting to work, for recreation, going on vacation. Our users will be able to get their current weather and 5-Day Weather Forecast in whatever city they live in or choose to visit in the near future.

## Usage

This weather app is well suited for you to prepare our users for their same day commutes, as well as prepare for the future commutes, with our easy-to-use weather search bar. Our users can type in the name of their current city, and a current weather forecast will distinguish itself as the largest display. Under the current weather display is the 5 day forecast in the city that the user searched. Thsi allows our user an accurate and up-to-date weather forecast for current and future weather. The Open Weather Map API uses geocoding, which will update the weather forecast based at that moment's time. If a user wants to see past search results, they will get a summary of past results displayed under the search bar as a quick view.
